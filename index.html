                        <h2>Omicron BA.1 & BA.2 Characteristics</h2>
                        <p>The Omicron variant's spike protein has at least 30 amino acid changes, 
                            three tiny deletions, and one short insertion. Notably, 15 of the 30 
                            amino acid changes are found in the receptor binding region (RBD). 
                            Other genomic areas have also had a lot of alterations and deletions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transmissibility:</strong> It is still unknown how quickly the 
                            Omicron variety can spread from person to person. The replacement of 
                            Delta by Omicron as the prevalent variety in South Africa raises worries 
                            that the Omicron variant may be more transmissible than Delta, although 
                            owing to the low number of cases in South Africa when Omicron arose, 
                            it is uncertain if this variant is more transmissible than Delta. 
                            Furthermore, the very limited number of cases described to date makes 
                            estimating transmissibility challenging. The alterations in the spike 
                            protein suggest that the Omicron version is more likely to transmit than 
                            the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, although it is impossible to say whether 
                            it is more transmissible than Delta.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disease Severity:</strong> It is still unknown if infection with 
                            the Omicron form is related with more severe illness. Because of the tiny 
                            number of instances linked to the Omicron variation, determining illness 
                            severity is challenging. According to preliminary data from South Africa,
                            there are no special symptoms linked with Omicron variant infection, and 
                            some individuals are asymptomatic, as with other variations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact on Vaccine-Induced Immunity or Immunity from Previous Infection:</strong>
                            There are currently no data to examine the capacity of sera from vaccinated people or 
                            those who have previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 to neutralize the Omicron variety. 
                            However, the United States Government SIG and worldwide public health partners are trying 
                            to generate this data in laboratory settings while also monitoring epidemiological and clinical markers.</p>
                        <p>The principal target of vaccine-induced immunity is the spike protein. 
                            The spike protein in the Omicron version has more modifications than in other 
                            variants, including 15 in the RBD. Significant reductions in neutralizing activity
                            of sera from vaccinated or previously infected individuals are expected based on 
                            the number of substitutions, the location of these substitutions, and data from 
                            other variants with similar spike protein substitutions, which may indicate reduced 
                            protection from infection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact on Monoclonal Antibody Treatments:</strong> There is currently no virus-specific evidence 
                            available to determine if monoclonal antibody therapies will continue to be effective against the Omicron strain. 
                            Based on findings from other variations with considerably less alterations in the RBD, the Omicron variant is expected 
                            to remain receptive to some monoclonal antibody therapies, while others may be less effective.</p>

                    <div id="delta-variant" class="delta-variant">
                        <h2>Delta Variant Characteristics</h2>
                        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant emerged in India and is currently widespread. 
                            Evidence suggests that it is potentially more transmissible than other variants.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transmissibility:</strong> Delta is the most transmissible COVID-19 variant yet. 
                            It could be as contagious as chickenpox—which spreads more easily than the common cold, 
                            Ebola, and the 1918 flu—says an internal presentation from the Centers for Disease Control 
                            and Prevention (CDC). Chinese researchers found that people infected with Delta had about 
                            1,000 times the viral load in their respiratory tract compared to those infected with the original strain. 
                            This variant also make people contagious in about four days, rather than six, as with other variants.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disease Severity: </strong>A comprehensive research done in England from late March to late May 2021 
                            discovered that among more over 40,000 COVID-19 infections, those infected with the delta version had around 
                            double the chance of hospitalization as those infected with the alpha type. The study, which was published on 
                            August 27 in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, takes into consideration factors known to influence 
                            infection risk, such as age and vaccination status. The great majority of COVID-19 patients in the research 
                            were either unvaccinated or had only received a partial vaccination.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact on Vaccine-Induced Immunity or Immunity from Previous Infection: </strong>Another Scottish study, 
                            published on June 14 in the journal The Lancet, discovered that people infected with the coronavirus delta variant 
                            had a nearly twofold increased risk of being hospitalized between April and June 2021, compared to those infected 
                            with the coronavirus alpha variant, or the variant first detected in the UK. Those who were vaccinated, on the other 
                            hand, had a 60% lower probability of being hospitalized with the delta variety than unprotected persons who caught delta.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact on Monoclonal Antibody Treatments: </strong>In a pseudovirus experiment, investigation of the efficiency of 
                            the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail against the variation revealed only a moderate (5-fold) reduction in neutralizing 
                            titers (6). The use of a single monoclonal antibody may be more difficult. The monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab was unable to 
                            neutralize the Delta version (7). This is not unexpected given that several of the critical changes in the variant's spike protein 
                            are situated inside the bamlanivimab binding region. Etesevimab (LY-CoV016) and Imdevimab, on the other hand, effectively prevented 
                            spike protein-mediated viral entry (REGN10987). This implies that the effectiveness of existing monoclonal antibody therapy should 
                            be assessed individually against the variation.</p>
